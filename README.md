# Voter-Prediction-Model
An AI-powered voter behavior prediction model using machine learning. Analyzes demographic and socio-economic data to forecast election trends and optimize decision-making.
🚀 Key Features
✅ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning – Handles missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
✅ Machine Learning Model Training – Implements multiple ML algorithms for prediction.
✅ Visualization & Insights – Graphical representation of trends and model performance.
✅ Prediction & Deployment Ready – Can be integrated into decision-making platforms.

🔧 Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to get started:

1️⃣ Clone the Repository:
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voter_prediction.git
cd voter_prediction
2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed, then run:
      pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Run Jupyter Notebook:
      jupyter notebook
Open voter_prediction.ipynb and execute the cells sequentially.

📊 Dataset
This model requires a structured dataset containing:
✔ Demographic Details (Age, Gender, Education, Income, etc.)
✔ Historical Voting Data (Previous election participation, party affiliation)
✔ Socio-economic Indicators (Employment status, urban/rural location, etc.)
✔ Ensure your dataset is stored in the /data directory before execution.

⚙️ Model Performance
The model is evaluated using:
📈 Accuracy Score – Measures overall correctness
📊 Confusion Matrix – Provides insights into classification errors
🔎 ROC Curve & AUC – Evaluates prediction confidence

🏗️ Future Enhancements
🔹 Integrate Deep Learning for improved accuracy
🔹 Deploy as a REST API for real-world applications
🔹 Implement real-time voter sentiment analysis
